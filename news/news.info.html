<h1>Media</h1>

    This tab is exploring the information from news and social media in the context of the exploration of water related
    topics that include when the weather is favourable to floods and the historical information from news and published
    research on these weather-related events and how to better take decisions to solve them. The water-related news are
    sourced in real-time using powerful text mining methods based on Wikipedia concepts to collect about 1500 news
    articles per day across more than 60 languages, of which a part relates to water events around the world. When
    selecting the Use Case in the main menu on the left, the real-time stream of news is automatically configured to
    search for topics that relate to the priorities and interests of the stakeholders that helped defining this view,
    thus addressing the local interests.

<p>
    The configuration of the news streams is done directly over the news engine API that is serving them but can be
    tested in the news monitoring part of the system. The user can choose water topics of interest and define priority
    levels, choose languages and categories, as well as define how rigorous this configuration must be, to model how
    much news articles the system is collecting.

<p>
    When the user aims to explore a certain water-related event, it can do so in the larger news engine EventRegistry.
    This will allow the user to further explore concepts related to the collected articles from a query, and the
    fundamental information that the news collection provides about the event. The user can explore the news through
    time and learn from what was published in the context of similar events in the region or other world regions where
    best practices can be derived and help planning for the future happenings.

    The system also allows the user to explore other topics that are related to the query formulated over news articles
    or events, to better understand how much are other topics (e.g. economy, education or ) associated with the water
    topic in analysis. At all times the subsample of news articles can be requested for further analysis.

    The social media is also present through Facebook and Twitter with different data access characteristics, and
    applications. Through the news engine Event Registry we are able to see the number of times that certain news is
    shared in Facebook and, thus, its impact in this online community.
    On the other hand, we are also collecting the tweets related to certain water topics based on key-phrases in the
    original languages and locations of the NAIADES Use Cases. In the tab “Twitter Dashboard” we present several data
    visualisation modules and search boxes where the user can further configure the search to access, e.g., the average
    sentiment of the posts or the main topics over keywords.

    Moreover, we are exploring the potential to extract real-time insights from social media based on the news story of
    a certain water-related event taking into consideration certain conditions from other data sources as, e.g., the
    weather. This interaction between news and social media is based on the ingestion of filtered news streams and on
    analytics on social media about weather-related events that can help decision-making and trigger alarms.

<p>
    In line with the capabilities offered by this comprehensive view, one example of its usage can start by the
    real-time news monitoring of water-related events regarding the recent flooding in Germany and Belgium, to configure
    the social media collection to the weather conditions in order to provide specific alarms. Then, to use the news
    engine Event Registry to explore news related to this event and other similar in order to study the sequence of
    happenings and use this to better plan for this events in the location of the user of the Water Observatory.
